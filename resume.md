Full stack developer with deep roots in each part of the stack. 

My 25+ years of computer-related work has been a progression through three realms: the first four years I was a UNIX sysadmin and taught myself enough to become network manager for a small tech shop. The next twelve years I worked on 'back-end' server-side programming and built a patented forms engine out of Apache, Perl, Tomcat, Java servlets, and DB2, capable of hosting thousands of college applications and other forms.

For the last nine and a half years I explored the 'front-end' client-side world of well-crafted dynamic web pages and consuming web services, by mastering Javascript, learning CSS and HTML5, and more recently helping build a single page app with Angular2 and Typescript. 

I remain keenly interested in continuing to learn this space and tackling the next challenge.
