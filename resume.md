I've been in this business for thirty years and I still write code every day and I still love it. I have three patents and I've defended them in court. I hired in and ran a twenty person development team. I've refactored code tied to a schema with a dozen tables, hundreds of fields and hundreds of thousands of records.  I'm the guy that found that bug that brought our app to its knees. I've been a sysadmin through setting up and configuring a (borg) until it became (the borg) and love the (mention cloud technologies) for that reason.

I care about user experience and the technology that goes into it.  Love overrides hate in my love/hate relationship with end users.
